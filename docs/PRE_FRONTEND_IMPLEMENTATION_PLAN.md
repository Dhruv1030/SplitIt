# 🚀 Pre-Frontend Implementation Plan

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Frontend Development  
**Decision**: Payment & Notification Services → Post-Frontend Implementation

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Based on analysis and strategic discussion, we've decided to **defer Payment and Notification services** until after frontend development. This makes sense because:

1. ✅ **Better UX Understanding** - See actual user flows before building notifications
2. ✅ **Payment Flow Refinement** - Understand settlement UX before payment integration
3. ✅ **Faster Frontend Start** - Focus on core features that frontend needs now

---

## ✅ What Was Just Fixed (Critical)

### 🔐 JWT Authentication in API Gateway

**Problem**: JWT tokens were NOT being validated (security vulnerability!)

**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. Created `JwtTokenValidator.java`

- Full JWT validation with proper error handling
- Extracts user ID, email, and roles from token
- Handles expired, malformed, and invalid tokens
- Consistent with User Service JWT implementation

#### 2. Updated `AuthenticationFilter.java`

- ✅ Validates JWT on every protected request
- ✅ Extracts and validates token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- ✅ Injects user context headers (`X-User-Id`, `X-User-Email`, `X-User-Roles`) to downstream services
- ✅ Returns proper error responses (401 Unauthorized)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

#### 3. Created `RouteConfig.java`

- **Public Routes** (no auth required):
  - `POST /api/users/register`
  - `POST /api/users/login`
- **Protected Routes** (auth required):
  - All other `/api/users/**` endpoints
  - All `/api/groups/**` endpoints
  - All `/api/expenses/**` endpoints
  - All `/api/settlements/**` endpoints
  - All `/api/payments/**` endpoints (future)
  - All `/api/analytics/**` endpoints (future)

#### 4. Updated `application.yml`

- Routes now configured programmatically in Java (better control)
- Kept JWT secret configuration
- Maintained Eureka and Zipkin settings

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Notification Service** | Need to see which notifications users want  | After frontend user testing     |
| **Payment Service**      | Need to understand settlement UX flow first | After settlement flow is tested |
| **Analytics Service**    | Nice-to-have, not blocking                  | After core features stabilized  |

## 🎨 Frontend Integration - You're Ready!

### Authentication Flow

```javascript
// 1. Register User
POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/register
Body: {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
}
Response: { "token": "eyJhbG...", "user": {...} }

// 2. Login
POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/login
Body: {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
Response: { "token": "eyJhbG...", "userId": "...", ... }

// 3. Use Token for Protected Endpoints
GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/me
Headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbG..." }
Response: { user details }
```

### Error Handling

The API now returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or expired token: Token expired",
  "status": 401
}
```

### User Context in Downstream Services

All protected endpoints now receive user context:

- `X-User-Id` - The authenticated user's ID
- `X-User-Email` - User's email address
- `X-User-Roles` - Comma-separated roles (e.g., "USER,ADMIN")

This means your services can trust this information without re-validating JWT!

---

## 🔧 Testing the Changes

### 1. Rebuild API Gateway

```bash
cd /Users/dhruvpatel/Desktop/SplitIt
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### 2. Start Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Test Authentication

```bash
# Should work - Public endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "name": "Test User",
    "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
  }'

# Should return 401 - No token
curl http://localhost:8080/api/groups

# Should work - With valid token
TOKEN="<your-token-from-register>"
curl http://localhost:8080/api/groups \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 🔒 Security Notes for Frontend Team

### Token Management

- Store JWT in `localStorage` or `httpOnly` cookies
- Include token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Handle token expiration (401 responses)
- Implement auto-logout on token expiry

### CORS

- Already configured for `localhost:3000` (React)
- Configured for `localhost:4200` (Angular)
- Configured for `localhost:5173` (Vite)
- Add your frontend URL if different

### Sensitive Data

- Never log JWT tokens
- Don't expose user passwords
- Validate on both frontend and backend
- Use HTTPS in production

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical

- [ ] Frontend can register users
- [ ] Frontend can login users
- [ ] Frontend can create groups
- [ ] Frontend can add expenses
- [ ] Frontend can view settlements
- [ ] All protected endpoints work with JWT
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### User Experience

- [ ] Registration takes < 5 seconds
- [ ] Login is instant
- [ ] Creating expense is intuitive
- [ ] Settlement suggestions are clear
- [ ] Mobile responsive

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "401 Unauthorized" on Protected Endpoints

✓ Check token is included in Authorization header
✓ Check token format: `Bearer <token>`
✓ Check token hasn't expired (1 hour default)
✓ Check JWT_SECRET matches between services

### "CORS Error"

✓ Check your frontend origin is in CORS config
✓ Verify API Gateway CORS configuration
✓ Check browser console for specific error

### "Service Unavailable"

✓ Check Eureka dashboard: http://localhost:8761
✓ Verify service is registered
✓ Check service logs: `docker compose logs <service-name>`

### Token Expires Too Fast

✓ Update `jwt.expiration-ms` in user-service application.yml
✓ Default is 3600000ms (1 hour)
✓ Consider implementing refresh tokens

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your backend is now **secure and production-ready** for frontend development. The decision to defer Payment and Notification services is smart - you'll build better features once you see how users interact with the core functionality.

**Next Steps**:

1. ✅ Rebuild and test the API Gateway
2. ✅ Start frontend development
3. ✅ Use Swagger UI for API exploration
4. ✅ Follow the phased development plan above

**Questions?** Check the docs or test with Postman/curl first!

Good luck with the frontend! 🚀
