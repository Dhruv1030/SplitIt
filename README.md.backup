## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services not registering with Eureka

- Check if discovery-server is running on port 8761
- Verify `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone` in application.yml
- Wait 30-60 seconds for services to register after startup
- Check service logs: `docker-compose logs -f [service-name]`

### Database connection issues

- Ensure MongoDB and PostgreSQL are running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check connection strings in `application.yml`
- Verify database containers are healthy: `docker inspect [container-name]`
- Check database logs: `docker-compose logs -f mongodb postgres`

### Kafka connection issues

- Verify Kafka and Zookeeper are running
- Check `spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers` configuration
- Ensure Kafka topics are created
- View Kafka logs: `docker-compose logs -f kafka`

### Port conflicts

- Check if ports are already in use: `lsof -i :[port]`
- Stop conflicting services or change ports in `docker-compose.yml`
- Default ports: 8080 (gateway), 8761 (eureka), 27017 (mongo), 5432 (postgres)

### Service startup delays

- Services may take 30-60 seconds to fully start and register
- Check Eureka dashboard at http://localhost:8761
- Use health check endpoints to verify status
- Increase startup wait time if needed
